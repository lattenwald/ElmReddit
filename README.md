# ElmReddit

## What is it

To be Reddit susbcriptions manager, for now it's only a viewer. Still might be useful.

## Installation

Just clone the repo.

## Running

Go to cloned repo and run `elm-reactor` (I am assuming you have `elm` installed),
then navigate to `http://localhost:8000/Main.elm` in your browser

## Caveats

It's work in progress, if it's not going to change then it's not going to work as intended.
